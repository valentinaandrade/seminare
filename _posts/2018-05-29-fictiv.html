<h4>Fictiv</h4>
<p>I've been working with Fictiv since 2018 as a lead frontend developer. In my time there, I've led the launch of the multiple new products, as well as countless features for the user-facing, admin-facing, and computational geometry teams.</p>

<p>In addition to my coding responsibilities, I've worked to mentor my fellow developers in best practices for modern frontend development and user experience.</p>

<p>I've been working with Fictiv in a fully-remote capacity since the beginning of 2019.</p>
